## This is a customizable Python project template 

Instructions to set up your Python project:
1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine. I would just delete git, rename the folder and start fresh.
2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**: Create and activate a virtual environment to manage your
    project dependencies. You can use `venv` or `conda` for this purpose.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Use the provided `pyproject.toml` file to install the necessary
    dependencies. You can do this using a package manager like `pip` or `poetry`.
4. **Customize the Project**: Modify the project files to suit your specific needs. Update the
    project name, version, description, and author information in the `pyproject.toml` file.
5. **Add Your Code**: Start adding your Python code, modules, and scripts to the project.
6. **Version Control**: Use Git for version control. Commit your changes regularly and push them to a remote
    repository if needed.
